# Air-Thief---CanSat

The aim of our project is proving that microbes exist at high altitudes  - more specifically 1-2 km into our troposphere. We want to build a satellite that is able to collect air samples from high altitudes. These samples would be then filtered in order to get rid of any contaminants leaving only the desired microbes in between the filters. Additionally, the results of our experiment, apart from promoting the idea that life is possible on other planets than Earth, could help understand better the life cycle of bacteria here on Earth. Painting a big picture of growth and needs of simple microbiological organisms could help us understand how to fight the harmful ones and how to effectively make use of neutral or beneficial organisms.

One of our main objectives is to make project an open-source - this means we want all of our work to be available online to potentially benefit similar projects in the future. Moreover, it makes following our project easier than ever. Below you will be able to view and download all of our projects. This is the purpose of our GitHub page.

# Introduction
The Air Thief team consists of 5 members from Akademeia High School. We formed a team as we believed the CanSat competition is a one-time experience that will allow us to polish our skills as well as gain newfound skills from the process. We came up with the idea of creating the Air Thief - a satellite that would be able to collect air from an altitude of 2km, which can be later sampled for microbes. Throughout the competition, we have brainstormed how we will achieve this, as well as have gained partners such as Adamed, Cloudferro, JLCPCB, CubicInch and Thorium Space Technology, who see great potential in our work and are willing to support us with their resources.

The medium through which we want to accomplish our mission is the CanSat competition - a competition organized by the European Space Agency with the goal of building a real satellite within the volume of a soft drink can. This competition takes place every year and is held to very high standards as initially, over 80 teams per country participate in the challenge.

There are many opportunities for patenting ideas, meaning this is definitely an area for business. As an example, the recent mission exploring life on Venus, which would require a satellite that would be able to collect microorganisms from the atmosphere.

# Hardware Specification

The hardware of the Air Thief CanSat consists mostly of elements that can be either purchased at your local hardware store or can be printed using a 3D printer. The following product tree describes all components required for construction of each subsystem, and lists all items that go into each of them. There is also a diagram that helps you understand what to connect to what
